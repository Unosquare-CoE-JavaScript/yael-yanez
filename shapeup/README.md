# Shape Up

No backlog.
No tickets.
No story points.
No daily stand-ups.

# Shapping

What current business / product priorities should we address?

- Set boundaries (fixed time, variable scope)
  - Figurate out how to solve _the problem_ on the fixed time.
  - You make the scope fit in the fixed time.
- Rough out the elements
  - Design at the right level of abstraction
  - **Breadboarding**: connecting all the component with all its actions and solutions (arrows) before building (drawing the solution). Makes easier to the designer cause you give him the freedom to build something that works on its own way.

  - **Fat marker sketches (visually solution)**: sketch out just enough of the visual design of the solution to be able to explain it to the designer. Doesn't has to contain all the wireframes, just has to contains the enough to explain the solution.

- Address risks
  - Once having the breadboard or the fat marker sketches and you know how the solution works, you get more people involve such as a senior programmer, a designer and a customer services representative and explain the idea and discuss all the risks in order to figurate out how to avoid as much risks as possible.
- Write the pitch (doesn't really go into a lot of details. It describes how it works, how to address the rabbit holes, etc..)

  ![Screen_Shot_2021-10-06_at_13 32 03](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82840886/136266752-f7cf1f5a-bd3f-42b2-847e-439f04cb2992.png)
  
  - Problem
    - Write down the problem
  - Appetite (in weeks)
    - How many weeks (no longer than 6 weeks) the business is willing to spent building the solution.
      - 2 - 4 weeks is a small batch
      - 6 weeks is a big batch
  - Solution
    - Write down all the solutions you came out with (breadboarding, fat marker sketches)
  - Rabbit holes
    - Write down all the problems and avoid solutions that the involved persons (programmer, designer) were able to catch.
  - No Gos
    - Write down all the temptations that can't be done, so the timeline does not get extended. Eg. _it could be tempting to move where we store the files from s3 to azure cause that could be better but were specifically not doing that._

# Betting

Which of these pitches do we want to bet on for the next build cycle?

- Betting table
  - Get the highest level people on the room (head of product, CEO, head designer, head programmer) to decide what have to be done for the next cycle.
- What about bugs?
  - Fix all the important and significant bugs but irrelevant bugs can the achieve in another cycle. Don't drop what the business has decided that is important to fix an irrelevant bugs.
- Clean slate
  - Clean all irrelevant tasks.

# Building

Ok, we got 6 weeks to build the solutions described in this pitch. Let's do this.

- Get one piece done: build the frontend and the backend at the same time.

- Mapping the scopes (bucket of work): you build your own scopes by listing all the tasks as you go.
- The hill chart: once you how to solve a problem, you go to the execution
