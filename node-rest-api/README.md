# Node.js REST API | Express & MongoDB - Solid Architecture
A secure products API with Swagger Documentation.

By using Express as a server and MongoDB for saving the users and products data; a user can signup, log in and get a JWT Token. 
This JWT Token is being needed in order to make any request to the secured Products API. If the JWT Token is valid, the user should be able to:
- Get a full list of products or if needed just a certain number of them by limiting the request.
- Get just a product by id.
- Create a product.
- Modify a product by id.
- Delete a product by id.

The whole API includes a whole Swagger Documentation, so developers can more easily know how to make the proper requests.
