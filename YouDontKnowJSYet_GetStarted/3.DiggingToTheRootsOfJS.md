# Chapter 3: Digging to the Roots of JS

# Iteration

The importance of the iterator pattern in in adhering to a standard way of processing data iteratively, which creates cleaner and easier to understand code.

- ES6 standardized a specific protocol for the iterator pattern directly in the language by defining a `next()` method whose return an object called an _iterator result;_ the object has `value` and `done`properties, where done is a boolean that is `false` until the iteration over the underlying data source is complete.

## Consuming Iterators

ES6 Iteration protocol allows to consume a data source one value at a time, after checking each `next()` call for done to be `true` to stop the iteration

```jsx
// given an iterator of some data source
var it = /* ... */;

// loop over its results one at a time
for (let val of it) {
	console.log(`Iterator value: ${val}`)
}

// Iterator value: ..
// Iterator value: ..

```

## `...` Operator

- The _spread_ form is an iterator-consumer.
- This operator has two symmetrical forms: _spread_ and _rest_ (or _gather)._
- To spread an iterator, you need to have _something_ to spread it into, such as an array or an argument list for a function call.
- Both next examples, the iterator-spread form of `...` follows the iterator-consumption protocol to retrieve all available values from an iterator and place them into the receiving context.

```jsx
// spread an iterator into an array,
// with each iterated value occupying
// an array element position.
var vals = [...it];

// spread an iterator into a function,
// call with each iterated value
// occupying an argument position.
doSomethingUseful(...it);
```

## Iterables

An iterable is a value that can be iterated over.

- The protocol automatically creates an iterator instance from an iterable, and consumes just that iterator instance to is completion.
- All built-in iterables in JS have three iterator forms : keys-only (`keys()`), values-only (`values()`) and entries (`entries()`)
- ES6 defined the basic data structure/collection types in JS as iterables;

  - Strings, arrays, maps, sets

  ```jsx
  // an array is an iterable
  var arr = [10, 20, 30];

  for (let val of arr) {
    console.log(`Array value: ${val}`);
  }

  // Array value: 10
  // Array value: 20
  // Array value: 30
  ```

- Arrays are iterables, so you can shallow-copy an array by: `var arrCopy = [ ...ar];`
- You can also iterate the characters in a string:

  ```jsx
  var greeting = "Hello world!";
  var chars = [...greeting];

  chars;
  // [ "H", "e", "l", "l", "o", " ",
  //   "w", "o", "r", "l", "d", "!" ]
  ```

- Maps have a different default iteration. In its iteration is not just over the map's values but instead its `entries`. An `entry` is a tuple (2-element array) including both a key and a value.

  ```jsx
  // given two DOM elements, `btn1` and `btn2`
  var buttonNames = new Map();

  buttonNames.set(btn1, "Button 1");
  buttonNames.set(btn2, "Button 2");

  for (let [btn, btnName] of buttonNames) {
    btn.addEventListener("click", function onClick() {
      console.log(`Clicked ${btnName}`);
    });
  }

  // for getting their values
  for (let btnName of buttonNames.values()) {
    console.log(btnName);
  }
  // Button 1
  // Button 2

  // for getting its value and index
  var arr = [10, 20, 30];

  for (let [idx, val] of arr.entries()) {
    console.log(`[${idx}]: ${val}`);
  }
  // [0]: 10
  // [1]: 20
  // [2]: 30
  ```

# Closure

A closure is when a function remembers and continues to access variables form outside its scope, even the function is executed in a different scope.

- Closure is part of the nature of a function.
- Objects don't get closures, functions do.
- You must execute a function in a different scope than where that function was originally defined in order to observe a closure.

```jsx
function greeting(msg) {
  return function who(name) {
    console.log(`${msg}, ${name}!`);
  };
}

var hello = greeting("Hello");
var howdy = greeting("Howdy");

hello("Kyle");
// Hello, Kyle!

hello("Sarah");
// Hello, Sarah!

howdy("Grant");
// Howdy, Grant!

function counter(step = 1) {
  var count = 0;

  return function increaseCount() {
    count = count + step;
    return count;
  };
}

var incBy1 = counter(1);
var incBy3 = counter(3);

incBy1(); //1
incBy1(); //2
incBy3(); //3
incBy3(); //6
incBy3(); //9
```

# `this` Keyword

`this` is not a fixed characteristic of a function based on the function’s definition, but rather a dynamic characteristic that’s determined each time the function is called.

- It's not a reference to the function itself and it's not pointing to the instance that a method belongs to.
- When a function is defined, it is attached to its enclosing scope via closure. But functions also have another characteristic besides their scope that influences what they can access. This characteristic is best described as an _execution context_, and it’s exposed to the function via its `this` keyword.
- The execution context is like a tangible object whose properties are made available to a function while it executes.

  ```jsx
  function classroom(teacher) {
    return function study() {
      console.log(`${teacher} says to study ${this.topic}`);
    };
  }

  var assignment = classroom("Kyle"); // this undefined

  var homework = {
    topic: "JS",
    assignment: assignment,
  };

  homework.assignment();
  // Kyle says to study JS

  var otherHomework = { topic: "Math" };
  assignment.call(otherHomework);
  // Kyle says to study Math
  ```

# Prototypes

Where `this` is a characteristic of function execution, a prototype is a characteristic of an object, and specifically resolution of a property access.

- A hidden behind the scenes linkage between two objects. This linkage occurs when an object is created; it’s linked to another object that already exists.
- Prototype chain: a series of objects linked together via prototypes.
- The purpose of this prototype linkage (i.e., from an object B to another object A) is so that accesses against B for properties/methods that B does not have, are delegated to A to handle.

  ```jsx
  var homework = { topic: "JS" };

  /* 
  	The homework object only has a single property on it: topic. 
  	However, its default prototype linkage connects to the Object.prototype object, 
  	which has common built-in methods on it like toString() and valueOf(), among others.
  */
  ```

## Object Linkage

- Create by the `Object.create(...)` utility.

```jsx
var homework = { topic: "JS" };
var otherHomework = Object.create(homework);

otherHomework.topic; // "JS"

homework.topic; // "JS"

otherHomework.topic; // "JS"

otherHomework.topic = "Math";
otherHomework.topic; // "Math"

homework.topic; // "JS" -- not "Math"
```
