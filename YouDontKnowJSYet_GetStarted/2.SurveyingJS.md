# Surveying JS

In JS, each standalone file is its own separate program and the reason this matters is primarily around error handling.

- Since JS treats files as programs, one file may fail (during parse/compile or execution) and that will not necessarily prevent the next file from being processed.
- _Many projects use build process tools that end up combining separate files from the project into a single file to be delivered to a web page. When this happens, JS treats this single combined file as the entire program._
- The only way multiple standalone .js files act as a single program is by sharing their state (and access to their public functionality) via the “global scope.”
- If a file is loaded via module-loading mechanism such as an import statement or a `<script type=module>` tag, all its code is treated as a single module.

## Values

Values are data, they're how the program maintains state and they come in two forms in JS: **primitive** and **object**.

- Primitive: strings, booleans, numbers, symbols, null and undefined.
- Object: Arrays and Objects

## Value Type Determination

For distinguishing values, the typeof operator tells you its built-in type, if primitive, or "object" otherwise:

```jsx
typeof 42; // "number"
typeof "abc"; // "string"
typeof true; // "boolean"
typeof undefined; // "undefined"
typeof null; // "null"
typeof { a: 1 }; // "object"
typeof [1, 2, 3]; // "object"
typeof function hello() {}; // "function"
```

## Declaring and Using Variables

- `let` allows a more limited access to the variable than `var`. This is called “block scoping” (useful for limiting how widespread variable declarations are in our programs, helping to prevent accidental overlap of their names) as opposed to regular or function scoping.

  ```jsx
  var adult = true;

  if (adult) {
    var name = "Kyle";
    let age = 39;

    console.log("Shhh, this is a secret!");
  }

  console.log(name);
  // Kyle

  console.log(age);
  // Error!
  ```

- `const` it’s like `let` but has an additional limitation that it must be given a value at the moment it’s declared, and cannot be re-assigned a different value later.

  ```jsx
  const myBirthday = true;
  let age = 39;

  if (myBirthday) {
    age = age + 1; //OK!
    myBirthday = false; // Error!
  }
  ```

- There are other syntactic forms that declare identifiers (variables) in various scopes. In the following example the identifier hello is created in the outer scope, and it’s also automatically associated so that it references the function. But the named parameter name is created only inside the function, and thus is only accessible inside that function’s scope. hello and name generally behave as var-declared.

  ```jsx
  function hello(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}.`);
  }

  hello("Kyle"); // Hello, Kyle.
  ```

- Another syntax that declares a variable is a catch clause. The err is a block-scoped variable that exists only inside the catch clause, as if it had been declared with let.
  ```jsx
  try {
    someError();
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
  ```

## Functions

In JS, we should consider “function” to take the broader meaning of another related term: “procedure.” A procedure is a collection of statements that can be invoked one or more times, may be provided some inputs, and may give back one or more outputs.

- Functions are values that can be assigned and passed around.
- A function declaration statement, a function expression can be defined and assigned like this:
  ```jsx
  // let awesomeFunction = ..
  // const awesomeFunction = ..
  var awesomeFunction = function (coolThings) {
    // ..
    return amazingStuff;
  };
  ```

## Equality and Equivalence Comparison

- "Triple-equals" | `===` | "strict equality" operator, compares the value and the type of value. Meanwhile the "double equal" | `==` | "loose equality" only compares the value, cause this second one allows type conversion..

  ```jsx
  3 === 3.0; // true
  "yes" === "yes"; // true
  null === null; // true
  false === false; // true

  42 === "42"; // false
  "hello" === "Hello"; // false
  true === 1; // false
  0 === null; // false
  "" === null; // false
  null === undefined; // false
  ```

## Coercive Comparisons

Coercion means a value of one type being converted to its respective representation in another type (to whatever extent possible).

```jsx
var x = "10";
var y = "9";

x < y; // true, watch out!
```

## JS Organization

Two major patterns for organizing code (data and behavior) are: **Classes** and **Modules.**

- Both patterns can be use at the same time, stick just with one or even neither.

## Object Oriented

### Class

A class in a program is a definition of a "type" of custom data structure that includes both data and behaviors that operate on the data.

### Class Inheritance

Inheritance is a powerful tool for organizing data/behavior in separate logical units (classes), but allowing the child class to cooperate with the parent by accessing/using its behavior and data.

- Use the extends clause to extend the general definition of a `Publication` to include additional behavior.
- The `super(..)` call in each constructor delegates to the parent `Publication` class’s constructor for its initialization work.
- The fact that both the inherited and overridden methods can have the same name and co-exist is called _polymorphism_.

```jsx
class Publication {
  constructor(title, author, pubDate) {
    this.title = title;
    this.author = author;
    this.pubDate = pubDate;
  }

  print() {
    console.log(`Title: ${this.title} By: ${this.author} ${this.pubDate}`);
  }
}

// here is the class inheritance
class Book extends Publication {
  constructor(bookDetails) {
    super(bookDetails.title, bookDetails.author, bookDetails.publishedOn);

    this.publisher = bookDetails.publisher;
    this.ISBN = bookDetails.ISBN;
  }

  print() {
    super.print();
    console.log(`Publisher: ${this.publisher} ISBN: ${this.ISBN}`);
  }
}

var YDKJS = new Book({
  title: "You Don't Know JS",
  author: "Kyle Simpson",
  publishedOn: "June 2014",
  publisher: "O'Reilly",
  ISBN: "123456-789",
});

YDKJS.print();
// Title: You Don't Know JS
// By: Kyle Simpson
// June 2014
// Publisher: O'Reilly
// ISBN: 123456-789
```

## Modules

Has essentially the same goal as the class pattern, which is to group data and behavior together into logical units.

### Classic Modules

_Classic modules_ are an outer function which returns an "instance" of the module with one or more functions exposed that can operate on the modules instance's internal (hidden) data.

- The class form stores methods and data on an object instance, which must be accessed with the `this.`prefix. With modules, the methods and data are accessed as identifier variable in score, without any `this.`prefix.

```jsx
function Publication(title, author, pubDate) {
  var publicAPI = {
    print() {
      console.log(`Title: ${title} By: ${author} ${pubDate}`);
    },
  };

  return publicAPI;
}

function Book(bookDetails) {
  var pub = Publication(
    bookDetails.title,
    bookDetails.author,
    bookDetails.publishedOn
  );
  var publicAPI = {
    print() {
      pub.print();
      console.log(
        `Publisher: ${bookDetails.publisher} ISBN: ${bookDetails.ISBN}`
      );
    },
  };

  return publicAPI;
}

var YDKJS = Book({
  title: "You Don't Know JS",
  author: "Kyle Simpson",
  publishedOn: "June 2014",
  publisher: "O'Reilly",
  ISBN: "123456-789",
});

YDKJS.print();
// Title: You Don't Know JS
// By: Kyle Simpson
// June 2014
// Publisher: O'Reilly
// ISBN: 123456-789
```

### ES Modules

- Introduced to the JS language in ES6
- There's no wrapping function to define a module. The wrapping context is a file.
- You don’t interact with a module’s “API” explicitly, but rather use the `export` keyword to add a variable or method to its public API definition.
- You don’t “instantiate” an ES module, you just import it to use its single instance.
- If your module needs to support multiple instantiations, you have to provide a classic module-style factory function on your ESM definition for that purpose.

```jsx
function printDetails(title, author, pubDate) {
  console.log(`Title: ${title} By: ${author} ${pubDate}`);
}

export function create(title, author, pubDate) {
  var publicAPI = {
    print() {
      printDetails(title, author, pubDate);
    },
  };

  return publicAPI;
}
```

```jsx
import { create as createPub } from "publication.js";

function printDetails(pub, URL) {
  pub.print();
  console.log(URL);
}

export function create(title, author, pubDate, URL) {
  var pub = createPub(title, author, pubDate);

  var publicAPI = {
    print() {
      printDetails(pub, URL);
    },
  };

  return publicAPI;
}
```

```jsx
import { create as newBlogPost } from "blogpost.js";

var forAgainstLet = newBlogPost(
  "For and against let",
  "Kyle Simpson",
  "October 27, 2014",
  "https://davidwalsh.name/for-and-against-let"
);

forAgainstLet.print();
// Title: For and against let
// By: Kyle Simpson
// October 27, 2014
// https://davidwalsh.name/for-and-against-let
```
